Network/internet outage monitor using WIZnet WS5100S-EVB-Pico

This project uses a WIZnet WS5100S-EVB-Pico attached to a spare Ethernet port on a local router. The Pico is used to monitor the Internet/Network connection for outages. 

The project was designed after chasing and tracking multiple home Internet outages.  


The program will:

•	Detect the Ethernet cable unplugged from the Pico or the Ethernet port

•	Detect Network or Internet outages

•	Light LEDs to indicate connection ok, cable disconnected and Network/Internet outages

•	Display tracking information through the serial port

•	Publish program start time, up time and outage time MQTT messages to a broker

   o	I used a Raspberry Pi as the broker and Node Red to post the information and write to a log 


Design:

•	The program is written in CircuitPython. Thronny is used as the editor.

•	Program file name is code.py. This allows the program to autostart on powerup. Note – the program will fail to start if the Ethernet cable is not plugged in.

•	The program will try to resolve a .com URL. I used dns.google. I also tested with my router URL.

•	The board and external green LEDs will be on during good connections.

•	If the program can’t resolve the URL, the external green LED will turn off and the red external LED will turn on.

•	If the Ethernet cable becomes unplugged, both the external and internal green LEDs will turn off and the external red LED will turn on.

•	The program will check the URL every 2 minutes and if there is an outage, it will check every 30 seconds.

•	All information will be displayed on the serial port.

•	Program start time, up time and outage time MQTT messages will be published to a broker. Note – outage time can not be sent until the network is back up.

   o	Optional – logging of program start time, up time and outage time.
