**Network/internet outage monitor using WIZnet WS5100S-EVB-Pico**

This project uses a WIZnet WS5100S-EVB-Pico attached to a spare Ethernet port on a local router. The Pico is used to monitor the Internet/Network connection for outages. 

The project was designed after chasing and tracking multiple home Internet outages.  


**The program will:**

- Detect the Ethernet cable unplugged from the Pico or the Ethernet port

- Detect Network or Internet outages

- Light LEDs to indicate connection ok, cable disconnected and Network/Internet outages

- Display tracking information through the serial port

- Publish program start time, up time and outage time MQTT messages to a broker

  - I used a Raspberry Pi as the broker and Node Red to post the information and write to a log 


**Design:**
- The program is written in CircuitPython. Thronny is used as the editor.

- Program file name is code.py. This allows the program to autostart on powerup. Note – the program will fail to start if the Ethernet cable is not plugged in.

- The program will try to resolve a .com URL. I used dns.google. I also tested with my router URL.

- The board and external green LEDs will be on during good connections.

- If the program can’t resolve the URL, the external green LED will turn off and the red external LED will turn on.

- If the Ethernet cable becomes unplugged, both the external and internal green LEDs will turn off and the external red LED will turn on.

- The program will check the URL every 2 minutes and if there is an outage, it will check every 30 seconds.

- All information will be displayed on the serial port.

- Program start time, up time and outage time MQTT messages will be published to a broker. Note – outage time can not be sent until the network is back up.

  - Optional – logging of program start time, up time and outage time.
