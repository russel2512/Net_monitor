**Network/internet outage monitor using WIZnet WS5100S-EVB-Pico**

This project uses a WIZnet WS5100S-EVB-Pico attached to a spare Ethernet port on a local router. The WS5100S is used to monitor the Internet/Network connection for outages. The project was designed after chasing and tracking multiple home Internet outages.  



**The program will:**

- Detect the Ethernet cable unplugged from the WS5100S or the Ethernet port on the router
- Detect Network or Internet outages
- Light LEDs to indicate connection ok, cable disconnected and Network/Internet outages
- Display tracking information through the serial port
- Publish program start time, up time and outage time MQTT messages to a broker
  - I used a Raspberry Pi as the broker and Node Red to post the information and write to a log 



**Design:**

- The program is written in CircuitPython. Thronny is used as the editor.
- Program file name is code.py. This allows the program to autostart on powerup. **Note –** *the program will fail to start if the Ethernet cable is not plugged in.*
- The program will try to resolve a **.com** URL. I used **dns.google**. I also tested with my router URL.
- The board and external green LEDs will be on during good connections.
- If the program can’t resolve the URL, the external green LED will turn off and the red external LED will turn on.
- If the Ethernet cable becomes unplugged, both the external and internal green LEDs will turn off and the external red LED will turn on.
- The program will check the URL every 2 minutes and if there is an outage, it will check every 30 seconds to determine if the outage has cleared.
- All information will be displayed on the serial port.
- Program start time, up time and outage time will be published as MQTT messages to a broker. **Note –** *outage time can not be sent until the network is back up.*
- Use a Raspberry Pi for the MQTT broker. Use Node Red for data presentation and logging of program start time, up time and outage time. **Note –** *a broker must be available to the program to publish MQTT messages. If one isn't available, remark all publish calls in the program.*

**Future enhancements:**

These are just ‘blue sky’ ideas. Some may not be valid or work. The biggest ‘got ya’ is the fact that the down/up information can’t be sent to the broker until the network is backup. This means the data will always cause a notification after the outage.

- Break up data for better data handling (ie, filling JASON fields and adding to databases)
- Deploy MQTT broker on PC and or Phone
- Use IFFT to send phone or text notifications
- Calculate downtime in the program or in Node Red
- Send Start, Up and Down data to external collection (ie ThingSpeak)
- Send notifications to a phone or PC directly from Node Red
- Add code to monitor multiple URLs, this could be used to monitor multiple servers or internal network devices (must have URLs)
